        This site is my way of opening my mind to you, dear reader. What you see
        will inspire you, and you will leave better clarity about what it means
        to live on this floating rock than you've experienced before. This isn't
        your typical professional shit blog. You'll actually be glad that you
        came to visit.

        For your pleasure, you can find my take on how humanity can strategize
        against the very real threat of climate change, the purpose of the
        internet in our lives, some longform musings related to the evolution of
        cryptocurrencies, some technical stuff, and a bit of political satire.

        You might as well check out some of my{" "}

        . Maybe you’ll find something useful about our complicated relationship
        with technology, or about the some existential crises that we face in
        the age of the anthropocene. Maybe you'll even learn something. Or maybe
        it'll take you to a dark, dark, dark place and you'll find yourself in a
        basement huddled into a ball overwhelmed with fear. If you read what I
        have, I will change the way you see.

        Concerning cryptocurrencies - the cryptocurrency sphere right now offers
        so much by way of innovation yet is still a hellscape of factoids
        propagated by charlatans. I feel that it's necessary to attempt to
        analyze it - that could be by assessing whitepapers, consensus
        mechanisms, or even the big ideas and visions - if we're going to emerge
        with a technology that is of real value to humanity. Otherwise, most of
        the time and effort spent by developers trying to innovate with
        cryptocurrencies will go for naught, and a whole bunch of valuable
        manhours that could have been spent on other means will That's why I
        dedicated a whole section of my site to it.

        Zooming out of the world of crypto politics is the world of real
        politics, where things have just turned so insane that satire has become
        a coping mechanism for me.

        There's also a{" "}
        <Link prefetch href="/bookshelf">
          <a className="side">Bookshelf</a>
        </Link>{" "}
        section where you can find some reflections on things that I've read.
        Books are entry points for pitches of real ideas. Discussion needs to
        continue outside of the text if these ideas are to have any legs. I
        don't get to analyze all of the books that I read, but I try to
        elucidate on the ones that I find the most galvanizing.
