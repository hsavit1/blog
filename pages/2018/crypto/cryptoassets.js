// 		<Title>Summary of <i>Cryptoassets</i>, by Jack Tartar and Chris Burniske</Title>

//         <P>
//            I give the authors Jack and Chris a lot of credit. Their book <i>Cryptoassets</i> is a book written a space where it was undoubtedly going to be under a huge amount of community scrutiny. With the crypto market suddenly exploding, there was a calling for someone to step up and make some sense of the mania.
//         </P>

//         <P>
//             Fortunately, I think the authors did a great job of getting readers up to speed with the history of crypto and outlining an investment strategy for navigating the future madness. 
//         </P>

//         <P>
//             I don't have time to go over all of the points that the authors made, however I'll outline a few important concepts and point out a couple of interesting investment strategies.
//         </P>

//             Telling the story of crypto through a historical lens is critically important for understanding what it really is and for making projections of where it is going to go. In the first few chapters, the authors outline how crypto came about as a response to the 2008 financial crisis and the failing banks. The centralized too big to fail banks simply could no longer be trusted to safely hold your money,and the system demands a more secure and decentralized technology to act as an alternative.

//         <P>
//             The authors tell the history of some very influential cryptos - Bitcoin (obviously) but also Bytecoin (which later forked and become Monero)  
//         </P>

//         <P>
//             One thing that I haven't heard abot

//             "We would not classify the majority of cryptoassets as currencies, but rather most are either digital commodities (cryotcommodities), provisioning raw digital resources, or digital tokens (cryptotokens), provisioning digital goods and services."
