    <Subtitle>Author: Johann Hari </Subtitle>

    <P>
      Hari's writing is chilling and brilliant. He paints a picture of the world
      from the eyes of someone who's been told seemingly all of the wrong
      information about what is wrong in his youth and young adulthood. To that
      kind of person, the world is a fine place - if something doesn't seem
      right to you, then you are probably someone who has been told that you
      have a broken brain chemistry.

    <P>
      This is what has plagued the people who have been suffering from
      depression - they are led to believe that their brains have failed them.
      Hari rejects this very American idea - he proposes that most problems
      really boil down to a misunderstanding of the environment that creates a
      stress on the person. Hari is a bit of a cultural philosopher in this way
      - he believes that reason and acceptance of reality for what it is can
      help us come to a truer understanding of ourselves. Once we have that, we
      can have a better understanding of our problems and can work towards a
      solution.
    </P>

    <P>
      These solutions oftentimes are an integration back into society, to
      re-establish the <i>connections</i> that have been severed by the high
      entropy state of the world as it is today. The numbers that Hari cites in
      the book are truly alarming - in our modern day screen culture, we're
      really more isolated than ever. Westerners check phones once every six and
      a half minutes, and they do this because they are trapped in a constant
      state of attention grabbing media and feelings of alone-ness. There is a
      completely fractured sense of community nowadays and it's not because we
      all suddenly have developed brains that don't function as they should.
      Rather, it's because we've forgotten what it means to be "connected" to
      the community. The average number of close confidants that people have in
      America is less than one. People are really lost in the world right now
      and they have nobody available to call on for help.
    </P>

    <P>
      One insight that Hari points out is the research that has started to
      materialize from psychedelic treatments, which have been overwhelmingly
      positive compared to that of SSRIs. The pychedelic treatments are not a
      panacea, however they are able to induce states that are comparable to
      that of professional meditators. According to one of those meditators, you
      "have to break the addition to yourself" - you have to allow yourself to
      destroy your sense of ego, so that you can re-evaluate your relationship
      to the world. However, Hari notes that you can't let yourself take this
      too far, because then you'd be the kind of impressionable and sensitive
      person that people would be afraid to let roam the streets by themselves.
      You have to be able to take a step back from your ego, then re-enter the
      world with a sense of clairvoyance.

      “Protracted loneliness causes you to shut down socially, and to be more
      suspicious of any social contact, he found. You become hypervigilant. You
      start to be more likely to take offense where none was intended, and to be
      afraid of strangers. You start to be afraid of the very thing you need
      most. John calls this a “snowball” effect, as disconnection spirals into
      more disconnection. Lonely people are scanning for threats because they
      unconsciously know that nobody is looking out for them, so no one will
      help them if they are hurt. This snowball effect, he learned, can be
      reversed—but to help a depressed or severely anxious person out of it,
      they need more love, and more reassurance, than they would have needed in
      the first place. The tragedy, John realized, is that many depressed and
      anxious people receive less love, as they become harder to be around.
      Indeed, they receive judgment, and criticism, and this accelerates their
      retreat from the world. They snowball into an ever colder place.”

      In my own writing, I plan on investigating more the problems that social
      media is pushing onto the masses. Hari chronicles harrowing stories of how
      the internet and social media have impacted us all.

      “She is not opposed to the technology at all—she’s on Facebook, and likes
      it—but “I say it is not what you actually need” at your core. “The kind of
      connection we need is this connection”—she waved her hand between me and
      her—“which is face-to-face, where we are able to see, and touch, and
      smell, and hear each other … We’re social creatures. We’re meant to be in
      connection with one another in a safe, caring way, and when it’s mediated
      by a screen, that’s absolutely not there.”

      The Internet was born into a world where many people had already lost
      their sense of connection to each other. The collapse had already been
      taking place for decades by then. The web arrived offering them a kind of
      parody of what they were losing—Facebook friends in place of neighbors,
      video games in place of meaningful work, status updates in place of status
      in the world. The comedian Marc Maron once wrote that “every status update
      is a just a variation on a single request: ‘Would someone please
      acknowledge me?

    <P>
      Happiness, Hari notes, also has different definitions, depending on where
      you grew up in the world. If you grew up in western society, happiness
      means looking more inward - essentially, living with hedonism. This means
      doing this for your own enjoyment and liberation. However, in Eastern
      cultures, happiness means engaging more with the community. The eastern
      peoples believe that happiness means injecting engagement into the
      community - not showcasing your individuality to everyone else. The
      western ideas of happiness seem to be tied to shorter attention spans,
      materialism, and ultimately - disconnection and loneliness.
    </P>

    <TLDR>
      We have an addiction to quick answers and easy solutions. Prescribing
      medication like Prozac and other kinds of SSRIs are mostly ineffective,
      and at worst, even more destructive than doing nothing at all. The
      solution to depression oftentimes is fixing the situation that the person
      has trapped themselves in. You have to break the person's addiction to
      their ego, and the person's addiction to their broken way of living. If
      you see someone in agony, show some sympathy, and see it as your moral
      obligation to try to re-establish their relationship with society, so that
      the hurting person can naturally come to the conclusion that it's not
      them, it's bigger than that.
    </TLDR>

    <P>
      I'll wrap this up with two more quotes that almost tell the entire story
      in just a few sentences:

      “Eastern philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti,26 who explained: “It is no
      measure of health to be well-adjusted to a sick society.”

      “To end loneliness, you need other people—plus something else. You also
      need, he explained to me, to feel you are sharing something with the other
      person, or the group, that is meaningful to both of you. You have to be in
      it together—and “it” can be anything that you both think has meaning and
      value.”
