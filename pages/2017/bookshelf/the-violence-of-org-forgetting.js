			The Violence of Organized Forgetting: Thinking Beyond America's
			Disimagination Machine{' '}
		</Title>
		<Meta date="December 10th, 2017" views={views} />
		<Subtitle>Author: Henry Giroux</Subtitle>

		<P>
			Nobody writes about the state of America today with the anger and
			clairvoyance of Dr. Henry Giroux. This book is among the most
			quotable that I have read - I felt the need to list down quite a few
			of them in my notes, and I have pasted a few of the more eye popping
			ones here. Trust me, there are many more and I highly highly
			encourage the read. It's a short one at under 200 pages, but it's
			chilling and will leave you with feelings of despair to the point
			where you have nothing to do but act out of that despair.
		</P>

		<P>
			I guarantee any people who read this book will feel that Giroux has
			gone over the edge with his language. I'd argue that he's the
			thinker that these reactionary folks need right now. I guess that's
			how some people view Nietzsche - you have to be bold enough to read
			him and embrace him. But Giroux isn't calling for people to
			recognize the non-existence of a spiritual deity. He writes lucidly
			about read world cultural shortcomings.
		</P>

		<P>
			His main point in this book is that the landscape of non-thinking
			and hyper-individualism, crafted and perpetuated by a corrupt
			"casino capitalism" political system, is destroying civic centers,
			our social circles, and our youth - the only thing we have left for
			our future. This is the "pedagogy of oppression" and the "culture of
			cruelty" that Giroux references again and again. He might come off
			as a bit repetitive, but that's only because he <i>has to be</i>.
			The culture is so pervasive that it matriculates itself into so many
			areas of public and private life.
		</P>

		<P>
			If we are a society that actually values the benefit of the people,
			we'd want our people to at least be able to think for themselves.
			This is not actually what our society looks like. Giroux calls our
			society the <i>disimagination machine</i> because those who live
			here are conditioned to not feel the pain of mutual cruelty.
			Imagination and thinking are not valued in America. Instead,
			hyper-celebritism and money dominate the American psyche.
			Libertarian and Republican political hacks have butchered the
			political system to work for only a select few, and the rest of us,
			including our children, are forced to live in a culture of economic
			pain and intellectual scraps.

			"A critical education in the broadest sense must take up the
			challenge of teaching students how to be self-reflective, how to
			thoughtfully and compassionately mediate their relationship to
			others, and how to reflect critically about the world that they
			inhabit. Simply put, students need an education that prepares them
			to be creative and critical participants in community and democracy"
		</Quote>

		<P>
			When the civic life and social spheres have been totally sold out to
			the private sector, we become isolated and forget who were are or
			what community we are a part of. This is how the disimagination
			culture gets perpetuated - through cultural isolation. Education is
			so important because it teaches us who we really are and how we got
			into the system that we are currently in. And without education, we
			have no critical thinkers. Without critical thinkers, change will
			never come.
		</P>

			"This culture of commodified cruelty and violence is only one part
			of a broader and all-embracing militarization of society that
			increasingly disconnects schools from public values, the common
			good, and democracy itself"
		</Quote>

		<Quote>
			"Corruption, commodification, and repressive state apparatuses have
			become the central features of a predatory society in which it is
			presumed irrationally "that markets should dominate and determine
			all choices and outcomes to the occlusion of any other
			considerations."

			"Civic life collapses into a war-zone, yet the dominant media are
			upset only because they were not invited to witness the golf match
			between Obama and Tiger Woods."

		<Quote>
			"We are plunging into a dark world of anti-intellectualism, civic
			literacy, and a formative culture conditioned to comply with the
			violations of privacy and power imposed by state surveillance and
			authoritarianism."
		</Quote>

		<Quote>
			"Against the politics of disimagination, progressives, workers,
			educators, young people and others need to develop a new language of
			radical reform and create new public spheres that provide the
			pedagogical conditions for critical thought, dialogue, and
			thoughtful deliberation."
		</Quote>

		<TLDR>
			Our thinking, our future, and our society is being constantly
			assailed by a capitalism structure that is rigged for a select few,
			which means that the rest of us are left without education and
			without a social sphere. Instant gratification and non-thinking are
			pervasive. Our government system simply does not work for the the
			betterment of its people. To reclaim our brains, a necessary step
			for finding solutions for our future, we need to construct a system
			that seriously values education. We need to galvanize people into
			being part of our civilization, and that happens through education.
			Otherwise, society and culture will continue to evaporate, climate
			change and other major problems will continue to snowball, and the
			termination of our species will be forthcoming.
