# Giant List of Human Created Bullshit that Will Lead to Unprecedented Human and Ecological Genocide Unless Immediately Recognized and Addressed

## Outline

#### Inspiration 

I am tired of being blindsided and emotionally paralyzed by countless media stories about how everything is suddenly going to total shit. This is reality of living in America in the year 2018. We are all passengers on a figurative bus that, if we don't find the courage to dramatically take control of the wheel and change direction, will soon be arriving at the Aushwitz of the 21st century. Unfortunately, because everything is seemingly on fire, nobody knows which direction to turn to. Confusion, nihilism, and whataboustism are suffocating us and preventing us from solving the problems that we need to solve to ensure the survival of life on Earth.

**Climate change** is the net result of all of our problems. If the Earth becomes uninhabitable except for a select few then we will witness a **mass extinction event of the human species**. This document outlines many of the human faillings that have lead to the problem of climate change. 

I am actively putting this list together to outline many of the human failings that aer causing the world to experience so much pain. Each one of these problems is **total bullshit** - they don't need to exist - and needs to be solved, but for one reason or another, has not. Ideally this list will be read by the masses and galvanize them with an incredible energy that they will use to recognize these problems, tackle these problems, and defeat climate change, before the damage is irreversible.

There is so much writing already available, however, it could be consolidated into one comprehensible list. I am providing links to articles and resources from credible sources that you can further explore.

#### The Climate Crisis 

The climate crisis is the ultimate crisis of our lifetimes. We have very little time before the crisis spirals out of control. It demands for disparate, marginalized, disadvataged groups to come together and recognize that there is 1 ultimate problem that we all need to pitch in and fight against with relentless energy. This shouldn't undermine the importance of fixing their unique individual problems or even deny their existence. Rather, the troubles that groups individually face should serve as a perspective for understanding how their unique problems play into the story of how climate change was created in the first place. We cannot solve the climate crisis without being able to look at each other and tell the story of how the climate crisis started in the first place. *We are all in this crisis together*. It's a metaphorical sinking ship and we all need to recognize each other and each other's problems, yet work together to try plug the leaking holes.

## List of Bullshit

### Climate Apathy

Climate apathy means that you recognize that the climate is changing, however you don't care about pitching in to help or involving yourself. This is Trump's "fingers in the ears" approach to the situation.

- [Climate Apathy is Worse than Climate Denial](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bj4ppq/climate-apathy-is-worse-than-climate-denial) - *Vice, Oct. 8, 2018*  
Points out that if we continue to not care at all about the problem, then there is absolutely no way that we will come to a solution. Apathy is a deep problem in this modern era.

- [Climate Change Edgelords Are the New Climate Change Deniers](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa9vg8/climate-change-edgelords-are-the-new-climate-change-deniers) - *Vice, Oct 10, 2018*  
An edgloard is someone who attempts to seem edgy by doing or saying risque or offensive things. Climate edgelords are people who say that there is no hope left, and promote the idea that it's more *chill* to do nothing about it.  The situation is very bad, but climate change will be better or worse based on our choices now. Apathy and cynicism may feel like a very mentally healthy form of acceptance of our collective fate—but these attitudes are actually just abdication of responsibility. What's more, antagonizing people for trying to build a movement for a cause you know damn well is worthwhile is an exercise in a sort of supervillain-esque misanthropy which demands that your entire species join you in suicide.

- [Donald Trump doesn't think much of climate change, in 20 quotes](https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/08/politics/trump-global-warming/index.html) - *CNN, Aug 8 2017*  

- [Ask a Scientist: How to Deal with a Climate-Change Skeptic](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/ask-a-scientist-how-to-deal-with-a-climate-change-skeptic) - *The New Yorker, Nov 17 2018*  

- [Gender Differences in Public Understanding of Climate Change](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/gender-differences-in-public-understanding-of-climate-change/) - *Yale, Nov 20, 2018*  
It’s striking to learn (according to Yale’s climate survey program) that 74 percent of women and 70 percent of men believe climate change will harm future generations of humans, but just 48 and 42 percent, respectively, think it’s harming them personally.

### Disasterous Government Climate Policy

- [What made solar panels so cheap? Thank government policy.](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/11/20/18104206/solar-panels-cost-cheap-mit-clean-energy-policy) - *Vox, Nov 20 2018*

- [US and Russia ally with Saudi Arabia to water down climate pledge](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/09/us-russia-ally-saudi-arabia-water-down-climate-pledges-un) - *The Guardian, Dec 9 2018*  
The US and Russia have thrown climate talks into disarray by allying with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to water down approval of a landmark report on the need to keep global warming below 1.5C.

### Ubiquitous Nihilism and the Death of Accepted Truth

Nihilism is a cause for apathy. When you engrain yourself in thinking that the end of the world is upon us and that there is nothing that you can do about it, then you lose all sense of critical agency.

- [Trumps Love Affair with Violence in the Age of Fascist Nihilism/](https://truthout.org/articles/trumps-love-affair-with-violence-in-the-age-of-fascist-nihilism/) - *Truthout, Oct 31, 2018*

- [How can I live longer? Researchers say the key to longevity may be simpler than we think](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/how-can-i-live-longer-researchers-say-key-longevity-may-ncna834981?icid=related) - *NBC, Jan 5 2018*  
People with a greater sense of purpose tend to engage in healthier behaviors, ranging from eating their veggie to flossing their teeth. Purpose is anti-nihilism. Pretty telling that feeling that your life is worth living also brings mental health benefits in a kind of positive feedback loop.

- [The Age of Post-Truth Politics](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/24/opinion/campaign-stops/the-age-of-post-truth-politics.html?module=inline) - *New York Times, Aug 24 2016*  

- [Actual Journalism Is Under an Asymmetrical Attack](https://www.thenation.com/article/journalism-asymmetric-politics-eric-alterman/) - *The Nation, Dec 31 2018*  
The right wing of the media ecosystem behaves precisely as the echo chamber models predict — exhibiting high insularity, susceptibility to information cascades, rumor and conspiracy theory, and drift toward more extreme versions of itself.” Benkler notes that this arose with “the emergence of a business model that stokes anger and outrage and reinforces identity-based politics just when the Republican coalition began to lean heavily on two deeply identity-based communities, namely, angry whites in the wake of the civil rights movement and the religious right pushing back against the women’s movement.” Today, right-wing sites account for an increasingly large portion of political-news sources, and they abide by no known rules of journalism. This explains why a YouGov poll in December 2016 found that nearly half of Trump voters believed that Hillary Clinton was running a pedophilia ring from the basement of a pizza joint named Comet Ping Pong.

### Unchecked Capitalism

Capitalism that is unchecked and unregulated can lead to an economy of masters and slaves that is rigged for those who are born into serious wealth.

- [UNHINGED GDP GROWTH COULD ACTUALLY DESTROY THE ECONOMY, ECONOMISTS FIND](https://theintercept.com/2018/12/05/climate-change-economics/) - *The Intercept, Dec 5 2018*  

### Failure of Global Democracy

Democratic institutions are failing across the globe as people become more apathetic to the democratic process, and feel less agency in the democratic system 

- [The Ecological Crisis is a Political Crisis](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2018-09-25/the-ecological-crisis-is-a-political-crisis/) - *Resilience.org , Sept 25 2018*  
Industrial civilization is being driven toward collapse by five key forces – related to terminal dysfunction within its ecological, economic, socio-cultural, and political sub-systems. Dissociation, Complexity, Stratification, Overshoot, Oligarchy. Breaking free from this destructive pattern will require us to take political and economic power back from the 1% and return it to the hands of citizens. To create a sustainable future, we must first learn the lessons of the past, and what archaeological research shows is that throughout history, civilizations that have been captive to the interests of an oligarchic elite have all collapsed.22 Today’s industrial, capitalist civilization is trapped in this same deadly cycle.

#### Rising Far Right Nationalism and Fascism across The Globe

The rise of far right nationalism across the globe is a real detriment to our co-existence. Far right nationalism means that countries will act out of their own self interest and are far less likely to try to work together to try to solve the problem of climate change.

### Failiure of American Democracy

The American democratic institutions are supposed to be exemplary leaders for the rest of the world. The failiure of a fair democracy in America gives other countries the excuse to act out of their own self interests. 

- [A leading Holocaust historian just seriously compared the US to Nazi Germany](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/5/17940610/trump-hitler-history-historian) - *Vox, Oct 5, 2018*  
A historian compares the actions of Mitch McConnell to that of Paul von Hindenburg, elected president of Germany in 1925, who was endowed by the Weimar Constitution with various emergency powers to defend German democracy should it be in dire peril. Instead of defending it, Hindenburg became its gravedigger, using these powers first to destroy democratic norms and then to ally with the Nazis to replace parliamentary government with authoritarian rule. 

- [Donald Trump borrows from the old tricks of fascism](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/30/trump-borrows-tricks-of-fascism-pittsburgh) - *The Guardian, Oct 30, 2018*

- [Progressives have nothing to learn from “nationalist” backlash politics](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/16/17978268/john-judis-wrong-internet) - *Vox, Oct 16, 2018*

- [Trump’s fascist efforts to demolish democracy](https://theconversation.com/trumps-fascist-efforts-to-demolish-democracy-106247) - *The Converation, Nov 25 2018*  
As an echo from the past, its principles and attitudes are re-emerging in a populist rhetoric that embraces extreme forms of nationalism, the cult of the leader, systemic racism, a culture of fear, a hatred of dissent and an utter disdain for the truth. Driven by a hatred of “the other” and infused with narratives of decline and victimization, fascist politics trade in an incendiary rhetoric of fear, demonization and violence.

- [How fascism works](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/19/17847110/how-fascism-works-donald-trump-jason-stanley) - *Vox, Nov 28, 2018*  
An interview with Yale philosopher Jason Stanley, who describes what fascism is and how Donald Trump is a fascist. "I think of fascism as a method of politics. It’s a rhetoric, a way of running for power. Of course, that’s connected to fascist ideology, because fascist ideology centers on power. But I really see fascism as a technique to gain power." Truth is required to act freely. Freedom requires knowledge, and in order to act freely in the world, you need to know what the world is and know what you’re doing. You only know what you’re doing if you have access to the truth. So freedom requires truth, and so to smash freedom you must smash truth. Nobody thinks of the citizens of North Korea as free, because their actions are controlled by lies.

#### Republican Political Corruption

Political corruption is when politicians are working out of self interest instead of representing what is of best interest to the community. Republicans are the most flagrant abusers of this kind of offense. 

#### Political Tribalism and Low Voter Turnout

Low voter turnout is a symptom that democracy is failing. In order for a democratic system to work, people have to be active participants in it. Partisanship exacerbated low voter turnout.

- [Partisanship is a toxin and a potent mind-altering drug](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/407889-partisanship-is-a-toxin-and-potent-mind-altering-drug) - *The Hill, Sept 22 2018*

How voter suppression became a political weapon in American politics.

#### Failiure to Vote and Vote Rationally

People are not voting rationally and are not voting for what is in their best interests. The point of this list is to help hone in on what matters.

- [THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL ACTION THAT MATTERS IS VOTING FOR PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE](https://theoutline.com/post/6388/the-only-individual-action-that-matters-is-voting-for-people-who-care-about-climate-change) - *The Outline, Oct 12, 2018*

### Massive Wealth Innequality

Wealth inequality is a huge factor in creating massive apathy, as the vast majority of people feel that the economy is rigged against them.

- [Wealth inequality is soaring – here are the 10 reasons why it’s happening](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/wealth-inequality-reasons-richest-global-gap) - *The Guardian, Apr 12 2018*  
By 2030 the richest 1% will own two-thirds of global wealth. But there are avoidable causes of this extreme wealth gap

- [How the rich will survive climate change disaster](https://theoutline.com/post/6595/how-the-rich-will-survive-climate-change-disaster) - *The Outline, Nov 16 2018*  
The rich do not care about climate change because they will have the necessary resources to move and survive. If money is concentrated near the top, it will be in the hands of people who don't care to spend it on climate science.

- [Billionaires Are the Lethal Monkey on the Back of the American Public](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/silicon-billionaires-are-the-lethal-monkey-on-the-back-of-the-american-public/) - *TruthDig, Sept 14 2018*  

- [Billionaires are the leading cause of climate change](https://www.gq.com/story/billionaires-climate-change) - *GQ, Oct 11 2018*  
Even though an overwhelming percentage of American's seen climate change as a threat, capitalists don't care to take a position regarding the state of the world. They take positions to enhance their wallets, not the Earth or our collective well being.

- [The Reason Many Ultrarich People Aren’t Satisfied With Their Wealth](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/12/rich-people-happy-money/577231/) - *The Atlantic*  
“The sensation of ‘being well-off,’” she wrote to me in an email, “is not about fulfilling a childhood dream of buying a sailboat or something; feeling wealthy is about comparison with others in your reference group. So the question is not what individuals want to buy, but what they feel they must buy in order to keep up their status.”

- [The case against billionaire philanthropy](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/17/18141181/foundation-charity-deduction-democracy-rob-reich) - *Vox, Dec 17 2018*  
We can't subscribe to the belief the innequality isn't so bad because at least the wealthy are *"donating"* money to charity. Many are doing so because of tax writeoffs and neoliberal implications. Big philanthropy — more than ordinary small donations that most people make — is an exercise of power. It’s an attempt to direct your private assets for some public influence, often with a naked aspiration to change public policy. And in a democratic setting, wherever power is exerted, it deserves our scrutiny, in order to understand whether it’s serving democratic purposes or undermining them. And philanthropy shouldn’t be exempt from that examination.

#### Money in Politics

The ultra wealthy have a huge influence on the next move of governments

### Threatening Nuclear War

- [This is exactly how a nuclear war would kill you](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/19/17873822/nuclear-war-weapons-bombs-how-kill) - *Vox.com, Oct 19, 2018*  
Vox lists the 6 easy steps to nuclear war, and how easy it would be for our world to be engulfed in a nuclear winter. They also list the top 3 potential nuclear wars, and demonstrate what happens in a nuclear attack. The threat of nuclear war remains strong even in 2018. In fact, it's one of the most likely disasters that could bring down all of humanity.

Pyongyang is not at all demolishing their nuclear missle program, as Trump insist's that it is

### Individualism 

Individualism is the Western created problem of living as and art of emboldening your own self interests. This is dangerous because we share the planet amongst ourselves and need to work together to solve problems that impact all of us.

- [This is what happens when you take Ayn Rand seriously](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/column-this-is-what-happens-when-you-take-ayn-rand-seriously) - *PBS, Feb 16, 2016*  
This piece discusses, using anthropological sources and examples from Sears and Honduras, how self interested organizations only wind up in chaos and failiure. 

- [When professionals sell out, we get a president like Trump](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-heffernan-trump-professionals-20181229-story.html) - *LA Times, Dec 29 2018*  
Doctors and lawyers, along with clergy, architects and engineers, are members of what used to be quaintly called “the professions.” Unlike a real estate promoter who runs casinos into the ground, heads up a fake university and promiscuously sells his ignoble name, professionals are expected to stand for something higher than profit. Many swear oaths in their fields. And they can lose their standing if they violate their profession’s ethical tenets. For professionals, shirking duties and dancing around fraud is not — as Trump claimed about his history of avoiding taxes — “smart.”

### Rising Loneliness

This is such a huge problem because when you feel disconnected from the community, you don't feel the urge to contribute to it.

- [An Epidemic of Loneliness in America?](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/opinion/letters/loneliness-epidemic.html) - *New York Times, Dec 8, 2018*

### Destruction of Natural Habitats

“Wild areas provide a lot of life support systems for the planet,” said the author of a study that found 77 percent of earth’s land had been modified by humans.

### Rapidly declining Animal Populations

Declining animal populations are a clear sign that humans are not respecting the planet. 

- [Humanity has wiped out 60% of animal populations since 1970, report finds](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/30/humanity-wiped-out-animals-since-1970-major-report-finds) - *The Guardian, Oct 29 2018*

#### Insects

Insects are at the bottom of the food chain. Without them, we could see a massive ecological extincion event.

- [The Insect Apocalypse Is Here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/magazine/insect-apocalypse.html) - *The New York Times, Nov 27, 2018*  
‘Nature’s resilient, but we’re pushing her to such extremes that eventually it will cause a collapse of the system.’

#### Microbial mass extinctions

We don't know how bad the pitfalls from this will be. Potentially catastropic.

- [Microbial Mass Extinctions Were Kicked Off By Human Evolution](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2094423-microbial-mass-extinctions-were-kicked-off-by-human-evolution/) - *NewScientist, Jun. 20 2016*  

### Rampant Racism

Racism has not gone away in America. Black people are still unfairly treated, which is dangerous and inhumane.

- [A new study reveals the real reason Obama voters switched to Trump](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/16/17980820/trump-obama-2016-race-racism-class-economy-2018-midterm) - *Vox, Oct 16, 2018*

In other words, when intolerant white people fear democracy may benefit marginalized people, they abandon their commitment to democracy.

#### Economic Segregation

Many people are born economically disenfrancised. When you're born into an economically disenfrancised society, you don't have the available tools to repurpose yourself into society.  

### Gender Innequality

When one half of the population is surpressed, then we are imposing serious limitations of what we can do as a collective people. 

- [The Big Picture: Confronting Manhood after Trump](https://www.publicbooks.org/pb-staff-favorites-2017-big-picture-confronting-manhood-trump/#fn-17894-1) - *Public Books, Jan 11 2018*  
We should be as suspicious of males who strongly identify as men as we are of white people who strongly identify as white. We should understand, in hindsight, that one of the reasons women were so keen to embrace masculinity in the first place was because it feels good to feel superior. And we should recognize, as well, that it is men’s belief that they should be superior to women and other men that is the cause of so much of their rage, self-hatred, and suffering. We need to stop talking about what it means to be a “real man” or an “empowered woman,” and begin talking, instead, about what it means to be a good person and a good citizen. Our nation’s future depends upon it.

#### Perpetuating Patriarchy 

Extreme patriarchies have higher maternal and infant mortality and worse child health.

### Capital Punishment 

Capital punishment leads to culture of cruelty.

- [Trump wants to see the death penalty come “into vogue” again. He’s wanted that for years.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/28/18032438/trump-death-penalty-pittsburgh-shooting) - *Vox, Oct 28, 2018*

### Poor Nutrition and Obesity

Poor nutrition leads to health problems and poor decisions. Obesity is linked to many kinds of physical and emotional distress.

### Addiction to Meat

With one dietary change, the U.S. could almost meet greenhouse-gas emission goals.

- [Huge reduction in meat-eating ‘essential’ to avoid climate breakdown](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown) - *The Guardian, Oct 10. 2018*  
Huge reductions in meat-eating are essential to avoid dangerous climate change, according to the most comprehensive analysis yet of the food system’s impact on the environment. In western countries, beef consumption needs to fall by 90% and be replaced by five times more beans and pulses. In rich nations, the dietary changes required are ever more stark. UK and US citizens need to cut beef by 90% and milk by 60% while increasing beans and pulses between four and six times. However, the millions of people in poor nations who are undernourished need to eat a little more meat and dairy.

- [If Everyone Ate Beans Instead of Beef](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/535536/?fbclid=IwAR07Dre_We90m8Kv9b4dklY25LIrcpFK6k1hnIiU4UukG34uabkJi_e2bws) - *The Atlantic, Aug. 2, 2017*  
Article points out how if we changed our diets to get rid of beef entirely, that would dramatically reduce the amount of methane and energy and water consumption. With one dietary change, the U.S. could almost meet greenhouse-gas emission goals.

- [The way we eat could doom us as a species. Here’s a new diet designed to save us.](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/23/18185446/climate-change-planet-based-diet-lancet-eat-commission) - *Vox, Jan 24, 2019*  
What’s needed, according to the peer-reviewed report, titled “Food in the Anthropocene: The EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems,” is a new philosophy for how to eat on planet Earth. Though there are huge variations around the world in what and how much we consume, we are all in this existential crisis together.

#### Fear of eating Insects

- [We could end factory farming this century](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/15/18088776/end-animal-farming-vegetarian-vegan-meat-alternatives-jacy-reese) - *Vox, Nov 15 2018*
"Expanding the moral circle is increasing the number of beings for whom we extend compassion and respect and rights and all these other instruments of moral concern. Ideally, in the long run, I want this moral circle to include all sentient beings."

### Fear of Eating Insects

Insects are a healthy and highly available source of protein. 

### Belief that Terraforming Mars should be the Primary Goal for Humanity

We shouldn't believe that Mars is a decent plan B. Living on Mars will be terrible. 

- [The case against Jeff Bezos’s and Elon Musk’s Mars colonies to save humanity](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/22/17991736/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-colonizing-mars-space-blue-origin-spacex) - *Vox.com, Oct 22, 2018*

### Addiction to Convenience

Convenience is what gives us short attention spans. With shrinking attention spans, we grow more and more incapable of drawing out plans to fix 

- [It's  better to be born rich than to be gifted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/09/its-better-be-born-rich-than-talented/?utm_term=.2a256a536916) - *Washington Post, Oct. 9 2018*  

- [Idleness as flourishing](https://www.publicbooks.org/idleness-as-flourishing/) - *Public Books, Oct 10 2018*  
There is not enough downtime. So Lightman argues in his brisk, persuasive essay. His snapshots of the relevant social science portray the grim effects of over-connection in our digital age: young people are more stressed, more prone to depression, less creative, more lonely but never really alone. Lightman ends with concrete, practical prescriptions: 10-minute silences during school days, “introspective” college courses that give students more time to reflect, electronics-free rooms at work, unplugged hours at home.

### Religion

Religion takes us away from our abilities to think and reason for ourselves. Climate change can't be solved if you believe that an almighty God is the puppeteer of everything. 

### Massive Over-Population

Over population at a time when humanity isn't equipped to solve a population crisis is a recipe for disaster. 

- [I’m an environmental journalist, but I never write about overpopulation. Here’s why.](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/9/26/16356524/the-population-question) - *Vox, Nov 29, 2018*  

### Screen Culture and Poisonous Social Media

Screen culture takes us away from our present awareness and distorts our perception of reality. 

- [No More Fomo: Limiting Social Media Decreases Loneliness And Depression](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751) - *Guilford Press, 2018*  
"Our findings strongly suggest that limiting social media use to approximately 30 minutes per day may lead to significant improvement in well-being."

- [No More FOMO: Fear of Missing Out Linked to Dissatisfaction](https://www.livescience.com/31985-fear-missing-out-dissatisfaction.html) - *Live Science, May 14 2013*  
FOMO, or Fear of Missing Out, is the sense that all your friends are doing something cool without you -- and social media lets you know about it.

The norms of reality TV have found a foothold in the digital age. The point is not that there is no reality — the point is that it’s every fact for itself, competing against all others, while social media multiply alternative versions of it. If you don’t like the reality you are facing, there is always another one, custom-made for your preferences.

- [Is the Internet to Blame for the Rise of Authoritarianism?](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/12/internet-blame-rise-authoritarianism.html) - *Naked Capitalism, Dec 8 2018*    
Whereas in the decentralized system problems were local, problems in centralized systems spread like wildfire. Furthermore, the predominant ad-based revenue model makes these problems look more like a feature of the system than a bug. Too much power is in too few hands and the ad-based revenue model is making these gatekeepers terrible managers.

- [Steve Jobs Never Wanted Us to Use Our iPhones Like This](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/opinion/sunday/steve-jobs-never-wanted-us-to-use-our-iphones-like-this.html) - *New York Times, Jan 25, 2019*  
Jobs envisioned a simpler and more constrained iPhone experience than the one we actually have over a decade later. For example, he doesn’t focus much on apps. When the iPhone was first introduced there was no App Store, and this was by design. As Andy Grignon, an original member of the iPhone team, told me when I was researching this topic, Mr. Jobs didn’t trust third-party developers to offer the same level of aesthetically pleasing and stable experiences that Apple programmers could produce. He was convinced that the phone’s carefully designed native features were enough. It was “an iPod that made phone calls,” Mr. Grignon said. He didn’t seek to radically change the rhythm of users’ daily lives. He simply wanted to take experiences we already found important and make them better. The minimalist vision for the iPhone he offered in 2007 is unrecognizable today — and that’s a shame.

It’s tempting, when reading a news feed full of rage and hysteria, to console yourself in the knowledge that it’s “just Twitter.” But behind those angry, hyperbolic tweets (well, the blue-check-marked ones, anyway) are people, and those people are disproportionately the most engaged and most influential men and women in American public life.

### Neoliberalism

Media's influence on politics diverts attention from real issues and hyper-focuses on the unimportant trivialities.

- [Neoliberal Fascism and the Echo's of history](https://truthout.org/articles/neoliberal-fascism-and-the-echoes-of-history/) - *Truthout, Aug 8 2018*  
As the state is hollowed out, big corporations take on the functions of government, imposing severe austerity measures, redistributing wealth upward to the rich and powerful and reinforcing a notion of society as one of winners and losers. Put simply, neoliberalism gives free rein to finance capital and seeks to liberate the market from any restraints imposed by the state. At present, governments exist preeminently to maximize the profits, resources and the power of the wealthy.

- [Neoliberalism Is Destroying Our Democracy](https://www.thenation.com/article/noam-chomsky-neoliberalism-destroying-democracy/) - *The Nation, June 2, 2017*  

### Hyper-Normalization

This is when you can't imagine what society could be like under a different structure or government, and you accept everything that your government does because you have no ability to transcending it.

- [The antidote to civilisational collapse](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/12/06/the-antidote-to-civilisational-collapse) - *The Economist, Dec 6 2018*  
Quote: "If you look at the New York Times, for example, it’s continually about that feedback loop between what Trump has said and the reaction of liberal elements in the society. It’s led to a great narrowing of journalism. So in a way, he is part of the hypernormal situation because it’s a politics of pantomime locked together with its critics. And it becomes a perpetual, infernal motion system, which is a distraction. It’s not a conspiracy. It’s a distraction from what’s really happening in the world. I would argue that there is a sense—in a lot of liberal journalism—of unreality. They’re locked into describing the pantomime politics and they’re not looking to what Mr Michael Pence is really up to, and what’s really happening outside the theatre." 
Another quote: "I think the old mass democracies sort of died in the early 90s and have been replaced by a system that manages us as individuals."

#### Domineering, Unfocused Technocratic Zealots

- [How technological progress is making it likelier than ever that humans will destroy ourselves](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/19/18097663/nick-bostrom-vulnerable-world-global-catastrophic-risks) - *Vox, Nov 19 2018*  
A philosopher makes the case that technological progress can make a civilization frighteningly vulnerable, and that it’d be an exceptionally challenging project to make such a world safe.

"Technology doesn’t solve humanity’s problems. It was always naïve to think so. Technology is an enabler, but humanity has to deal with humanity’s problems. I think we’re both over-reliant on technology as a way to solve things and probably, at this moment, over-indexing on technology as a source of all problems, too."

- [The World Silicon Valley Made](https://www.publicbooks.org/the-world-silicon-valley-made/) - *Public Books, Oct 17 2018*  

#### Celebration of Wealth over Virtue

When we celebrate the rich over the virtuous, we forget that money is just a medium of exchange, and not a measure of good will.

#### Sports Culture

Sports culture accentuates and celebrates tribalism, screen culture, and celebritism. 

### Fear of Death and Mortality

Socrates beleived that in order to live a good life, you must understand death. Fear of death is the driver of hedonic lifestyles, which are unhelpful. This generation has a fear of mortality which gives rise to individualism. 

### A Health Care system that doesn't offer Protection or Care for the Vulnerable

Taking away health care from the vulnerable sends a signal that the society doesn't care about the well being of it's citizens.

- [Health Care, Hatred and Lies](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/opinion/trump-republican-hate.html) - *New York Times, Oct 25 2018*

#### Physical Ailments

We might be physically unable to think and live at a level that is necessary to tackle problems. All of this could be preventable.

How improving air quality could add years to people’s lives around the world.

### A Culture that doesn't Value Knowledge or Education

When education isn't valued, we lose discovering potential solutions to our problems. History repeats itself if we can't learn from it. 

- [The Big Picture: Trump's attack on knowledge](https://www.publicbooks.org/the-big-picture-trumps-attack-on-knowledge/) - *Public Books, Nov 29 2017*  
Trump’s contempt for knowledge undermines the work of those who do bring expertise to their jobs. Perhaps this signals a fear that their knowledge will diminish his authority or be used to challenge his personal opinions. Trump campaigned against knowledge. He systematically discourages relying on knowledge. He publicly devalues it, mocks it in tweets, belittles those who raise evidence-based questions about his policy preferences. This worked for him in connecting to the large part of the American public that had become disillusioned with experts and elites. Instead of a public sphere where views are subjected to debate and rational-critical analysis—ideally informed by knowledge—we seem currently to have only counter-publics, separate arenas trying to achieve their own critical mass and contest the alleged domination of a nonexistent conventional wisdom.

#### Underfunded and Broken Childhood Education Systems

Childhood education is critically important for cognitive development. 

- [Early childhood education yields big benefits — just not the ones you think](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/16/17928164/early-childhood-education-doesnt-teach-kids-fund-it) - *Vox, Oct 16, 2018*  

- [Students Learn From People They Love](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/learning-emotion-education.html) - *New York Times, Jan 17 2019*  
If we don't respect the teachers who have to bring passion to the workplace everyday, then we cannot expect that our children will learn much. How would you design a school if you wanted to put relationship quality at the core?

#### A Culture that doesn't Appreciate it's Heritage

When we reject our heritage, then we resort to nativism and believe that what we have was rightfully earned. 

- [As forests are cleared and species vanish, there's one other loss: a world of languages](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/08/why-we-are-losing-a-world-of-languages) - *The Guardian, Jun 7 2014*  
A new report shows a direct link between disappearing habitats and the loss of languages. One in four of the world's 7,000 spoken tongues is now at risk of falling silent for ever as the threat to cultural biodiversity grows

### No Ability to Think & Perceive Physical Dimensions that are Higher than our Own

Arguably, if we could understand higher dimensions, then we could have better optics on our existence and be more driven to preserve our future.

### Rejection of Theraputic Drugs

A society that reject drugs is not only one that rejects extraneous thinking and new ideas, but also rejects the idea of therapy

- [The extraordinary therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs, explained](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/1/10/18007558/psychedelics-ayahuasca-depression-pollan-mental-health) - *Vox, Jan 13, 2019*  
Our minds develop patterns as we navigate the world. These patterns harden as you get older. After a while, you stop realizing how conditioned you’ve become — you’re just responding to stimuli in predictable ways. Eventually, your brain becomes what Michael Pollan has aptly called an “uncertainty-reducing machine,” obsessed with securing the ego and locked in uncontrollable loops that reinforce self-destructive habits. Taking psychedelics is like shaking the snow globe, Carhart-Harris said. It disrupts these patterns and explodes cognitive barriers. It also interacts with what’s called the default mode network (DMN), the part of the brain associated with mental chatter, self-absorption, memories, and emotions. 

### Plastics in Water Sources

Impure water is dangerous to ecosystems and human health.

### Incapable of Seeing the Current Place of Humanity in the context of All of History

The inability to see how we got here and how quickly we are blowing it, makes it difficult to understand what exactly we should do next.

Our era will be seen as a bleak period — another Gilded Age but worse

### Incareration State

A state that imprisons everyone creates a culture of enslavement, apathy, mistrust, and lack of agency.

#### The Failiure of the War on Drugs

The war on drugs has incarcerated the most vulnerable, instead of educating them back into becoming productive members of our society. 

- [The case for prescription heroin](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/12/15301458/canada-prescription-heroin-opioid-addiction) - *Vox, Jun 12, 2017*  
The idea is this: If some people are going to use heroin no matter what, it’s better to give them a safe source of the stuff and a safe place to inject it, rather than letting them pick it up on the street — laced with who knows what — and possibly overdose without medical supervision. Patients can not only avoid death by overdose but otherwise go about their lives without stealing or committing other crimes to obtain heroin.

By 2030, global greenhouse gas emissions could be 1.5 to 2.2 GtCO2e/year lower if individual commitments from nearly 6,000 cities, states and regions, and over 2,000 companies are fully implemented, compared to what would be achieved through national policies that are currently underway. This potential reduction amounts to roughly double Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2016.

  There is no specific order or ranking. I believe that all of these problems need to be addressed if we are going to make progress. That is why they are all on the same list.

  <summary>Why did you design it like this?</summary>
  I want to have most of the information about human suffering available in 1 document for a reason. I don't want people to say *"well, what about MY problems"* and then immediately bounce off of this page and do something else. We need people to be energized and galvanized. I also wanted to make this as simple as possible to contribute to.

  <summary>I don't believe in climate change. What is in it for me?</summary>
  You are living in a fictional reality. When you cannot recognize the overwhelming evidence of climate change, you are living in a fictional reality of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. It may not be your fault. Republicans have poisoned the academic sphere for years with anti-climate-change rhetoric. Explore as many of the provided resources as you can. The most enlightened of us are working towards fixing the problem, yet we still need the help of people like you. This problem involves all of us.

## Roadmap

This is a living document, written entirely in one Markdown file, and managed with the git version control system. Topics listed are subject to change, albeit infrequently. If you'd like to contribute, fork this project and open up a pull request on [Github](https://github.com/hsavit1/blog/blob/master/components/docs/docs/docs.mdx). For more on how to use Git and Github, see the [Github leaning guides](https://services.github.com/on-demand/resources/learning-path/). And if you need a markdown editor to edit this document with, I recommend [Typora](https://typora.io/) - it's free to download

Ideally, this document will be expanded into many side projects that will project this information in alternative ways. This mdx document can serve as the home base document that all other forms of presentation can be based off of.

Things to do:

1. [ ] Short descriptions for every cited article
2. [ ] Move to hosting on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)
3. [ ] Support Languages other than English
4. [ ] Support for making country-specific versions of this document
5. [ ] Create a Visual Slide Deck Presentation using [MDX-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) and host a website using Zeit
6. [ ] Mirror this repository on Github so that it functions as a standalone 
7. [ ] Create social media accounts to promote the content and spread the message
