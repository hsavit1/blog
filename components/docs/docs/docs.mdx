# Giant List of Human Created Bullshit that Will Lead to Unprecedented Human and Ecological Genocide Unless Immediately Recognized and Addressed

## Outline

#### Inspiration 

I am tired of being blindsided and emotionally paralyzed by countless media stories about how everything is suddenly going to total shit. This is reality of living in America in the year 2018. We are all passengers on a figurative bus that, if we don't find the courage to dramatically take control of the wheel and change direction, will soon be arriving at the Aushwitz of the 21st century. Unfortunately, because everything is seemingly on fire, nobody knows which direction to turn to. Confusion, nihilism, and whataboustism are suffocating and preventing us from solving the problems that we need to solve to ensure the survival of life on Earth.

**Climate change** is the net result of all of our problems. If the Earth becomes uninhabitable except for a select few then we will witness a **mass extinction event of the human species**. This document outlines many of the human faillings that have lead to the problem of climate change. 

I am actively putting this list together to categorically outline all of the human reasons of why the world is experiencing so much pain. Each one of these problems is **total bullshit** and needs to be solved, but for one reason or another, hasn't. Ideally this list will be read by the masses and galvanize them with an incredible energy that they will use to recognize these problems, tackle these problems, and defeat climate change, before the damage is irreversible.

There is so much writing already available, however, it could be consolidated into one comprehensible list. I am providing links to articles and resources from credible sources that you can further explore.

#### The Climate Crisis 

The climate crisis is the ultimate crisis of our lifetimes. We have very little time before the crisis spirals out of control. It demands for disparate, marginalized, disadvataged groups to come together and recognize that there is 1 ultimate problem that we all need to pitch in and fight against with relentless energy. This shouldn't undermine the importance of fixing their unique individual problems or even deny their existence. Rather, the troubles that groups individually face should serve as a perspective for understanding how their unique problems play into the story of how climate change was created in the first place. We cannot solve the climate crisis without being able to look at each other and tell the story of how the climate crisis started in the first place. *We are all in this crisis together*. It's a metaphorical sinking ship and we all need to recognize each other and each other's problems, yet work together to try plug the leaking holes.

## List of Bullshit

### Climate Apathy

Climate apathy means that you recognize that the climate is changing, however you don't care about pitching in to help or involving yourself. This is Trump's "fingers in the ears" approach to the situation.

- [Climate Apathy is Worse than Climate Denial](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bj4ppq/climate-apathy-is-worse-than-climate-denial) - *Vice, Oct. 8, 2018*  
Points out that if we continue to not care at all about the problem, then there is absolutely no way that we will come to a solution. Apathy is a deep problem in this modern era. 

### Unchecked Capitalism

This is a debatable entry, because the alternatives to capitalism have been historically unsustainable. However, capitalism that is unchecked and unregulated can lead to an economy of masters and slaves that is rigged for those who are born into serious wealth.

- [The Problem with Capitalism? Capitalists](https://hbr.org/2010/09/the-problem-with-capitalism-ca) - *Harvard Business Review, Sept. 2010*  

- [Criticism of capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism) - *Wikipedia*  

### Massive Wealth Innequality

### Threatening Nuclear War

- [This is exactly how a nuclear war would kill you](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/19/17873822/nuclear-war-weapons-bombs-how-kill) - *Vox.com, Oct 19, 2018*  
Vox lists the 6 easy steps to nuclear war, and how easy it would be for our world to be engulfed in a nuclear winter. They also list the top 3 potential nuclear wars, and demonstrate what happens in a nuclear attack. The threat of nuclear war remains strong even in 2018. In fact, it's one of the most likely disasters that could bring down all of humanity. 

### Individualism

Individualism is the Western problem 

### Failiure to Recognize Mass Biodiversity Extinction Event

#### Insects

#### Microbial

### Racism

#### A Culture that doesn't Appreciate it's Heritage

### Inability to Recogize Real Threats to Humanity

With one dietary change, the U.S. could almost meet greenhouse-gas emission goals.

- [If Everyone Ate Beans Instead of Beef](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/535536/?fbclid=IwAR07Dre_We90m8Kv9b4dklY25LIrcpFK6k1hnIiU4UukG34uabkJi_e2bws) - *The Atlantic, Aug. 2, 2017*  
Article points out how if we changed our diets to get rid of beef entirely, that would dramatically reduce the amount of methane and energy and water consumption. With one dietary change, the U.S. could almost meet greenhouse-gas emission goals.

#### Fear of eating Insects

### Misunderstanding of reality

#### No ability to think and live and perceive dimensions that are higher than our own

### The Failiure of the War on Drugs

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>How can I help you make this list even better?</summary>
  Tell your friends. Open up a pull request
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is this format inspired by?</summary>
  The Zeit team has done an excellent job in contributing to the open source community. I would have struggled to create this without their help. Additionally, the Awesome list series on Github is an incredible example of what individual list countribution can bring to the community as a whole.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>You forgot something. Why didn't you list my problem?</summary>
  I am not perfect and I don't have scope into everyone's problems. I am going off of what I perceive to be the most major problems in the world. If you believe that I've missed something, please open up a pull request with a detailed explanation of why a problem you see needs to be added.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How did you order and rank these problems?</summary>
  There is no specific order or ranking. I believe that all of these problems need to be addressed if we are going to make progress. That is why they are all on the same list.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why did you design it like this?</summary>
  I want to have most of the information about human suffering available in 1 document for a reason. I don't want people to say *"well, what about MY problems"* and then immediately bounce off of this page and do something else. We need people to be energized and galvanized. I also wanted to make this as simple as possible to contribute to.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I don't believe in climate change. What is in it for me?</summary>
  You are living in a fictional reality. When you cannot recognize the overwhelming evidence of climate change, you are living in a fictional reality of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. It may not be your fault. Republicans have poisoned the academic sphere for years with anti-climate-change rhetoric. Explore as many of the provided resources as you can. The most enlightened of us are working towards fixing the problem, yet we still need the help of people like you. This problem involves all of us.
