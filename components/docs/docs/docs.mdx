# Giant List of Human Created Bullshit that Will Lead to Unprecedented Human and Ecological Genocide Unless Immediately Recognized and Addressed

## Outline

#### Inspiration 

I am tired of being blindsided and emotionally paralyzed by countless media stories about how everything is suddenly going to total shit. This is reality of living in America in the year 2018. We are all passengers on a figurative bus that, if we don't find the courage to dramatically take control of the wheel and change direction, will soon be arriving at the Aushwitz of the 21st century. Unfortunately, because everything is seemingly on fire, nobody knows which direction to turn to. Confusion, nihilism, and whataboustism are suffocating and preventing us from solving the problems that we need to solve to ensure the survival of life on Earth.

**Climate change** is the net result of all of our problems. If the Earth becomes uninhabitable except for a select few then we will witness a **mass extinction event of the human species**. This document outlines many of the human faillings that have lead to the problem of climate change. 

I am actively putting this list together to categorically outline all of the human reasons of why the world is experiencing so much pain. Each one of these problems is **total bullshit** and needs to be solved, but for one reason or another, hasn't. Ideally this list will be read by the masses and galvanize them with an incredible energy that they will use to recognize these problems, tackle these problems, and defeat climate change, before the damage is irreversible.

There is so much writing already available, however, it could be consolidated into one comprehensible list. I am providing links to articles and resources from credible sources that you can further explore.

#### The Climate Crisis 

The climate crisis is the ultimate crisis of our lifetimes. We have very little time before the crisis spirals out of control. It demands for disparate, marginalized, disadvataged groups to come together and recognize that there is 1 ultimate problem that we all need to pitch in and fight against with relentless energy. This shouldn't undermine the importance of fixing their unique individual problems or even deny their existence. Rather, the troubles that groups individually face should serve as a perspective for understanding how their unique problems play into the story of how climate change was created in the first place. We cannot solve the climate crisis without being able to look at each other and tell the story of how the climate crisis started in the first place. *We are all in this crisis together*. It's a metaphorical sinking ship and we all need to recognize each other and each other's problems, yet work together to try plug the leaking holes.

## List of Bullshit

### Climate Apathy

Climate apathy means that you recognize that the climate is changing, however you don't care about pitching in to help or involving yourself. This is Trump's "fingers in the ears" approach to the situation.

- [Climate Apathy is Worse than Climate Denial](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bj4ppq/climate-apathy-is-worse-than-climate-denial) - *Vice, Oct. 8, 2018*  
Points out that if we continue to not care at all about the problem, then there is absolutely no way that we will come to a solution. Apathy is a deep problem in this modern era.
- [Climate Change Edgelords Are the New Climate Change Deniers](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa9vg8/climate-change-edgelords-are-the-new-climate-change-deniers) - *Vice, Oct 10, 2018*  
An edgloard is someone who attempts to seem edgy by doing or saying risque or offensive things. Climate edgelords are people who say that there is no hope left, and promote the idea that it's more *chill* to do nothing about it.  The situation is very bad, but climate change will be better or worse based on our choices now. Apathy and cynicism may feel like a very mentally healthy form of acceptance of our collective fate—but these attitudes are actually just abdication of responsibility. What's more, antagonizing people for trying to build a movement for a cause you know damn well is worthwhile is an exercise in a sort of supervillain-esque misanthropy which demands that your entire species join you in suicide.

### Ubiquitous Nihilism

Nihilism is a cause for apathy. When you engrain yourself in thinking that the end of the world is upon us and that there is nothing that you can do about it, then you lose all sense of critical agency.

### Unchecked Capitalism

Capitalism that is unchecked and unregulated can lead to an economy of masters and slaves that is rigged for those who are born into serious wealth.

- [The Problem with Capitalism? Capitalists](https://hbr.org/2010/09/the-problem-with-capitalism-ca) - *Harvard Business Review, Sept. 2010*

### Failure of Global Democracy

Democratic institutions are failing across the globe as people become more apathetic to the democratic process, and feel less agency in the democratic system 

#### Rising Far Right Nationalism and Fascism across The Globe

The rise of far right nationalism across the globe is a real detriment to our co-existence. Far right nationalism means that countries will act out of their own self interest and are far less likely to try to work together to try to solve the problem of climate change.

### Failiure of American Democracy

The American democratic institutions are supposed to be exemplary leaders for the rest of the world. The failiure of a fair democracy in America gives other countries the excuse to act out of their own self interests.

A historian compares the actions of Mitch McConnell to that of Paul von Hindenburg, elected president of Germany in 1925, who was endowed by the Weimar Constitution with various emergency powers to defend German democracy should it be in dire peril. Instead of defending it, Hindenburg became its gravedigger, using these powers first to destroy democratic norms and then to ally with the Nazis to replace parliamentary government with authoritarian rule.

#### Republican Political Corruption

Political corruption is when politicians are working out of self interest instead of representing what is of best interest to the community. Republicans are the most flagrant abusers of this kind of offense. 

#### Low Voter Turnout

Low voter turnout is a symptom that democracy is failing. In order for a democratic system to work, people have to be active participants in it.  

#### Failiure to Vote in Rationally

People are not voting rationally and are not voting for what is in their best interests

- [THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL ACTION THAT MATTERS IS VOTING FOR PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE](https://theoutline.com/post/6388/the-only-individual-action-that-matters-is-voting-for-people-who-care-about-climate-change) - *The Outline, Oct 12, 2018*

### Massive Wealth Innequality

Wealth inequality is a huge factor in creating massive apathy, as the vast majority of people feel that the economy is rigged against them.

- [Wealth inequality is soaring – here are the 10 reasons why it’s happening](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/wealth-inequality-reasons-richest-global-gap) - *The Guardian, Apr 12 2018*  
By 2030 the richest 1% will own two-thirds of global wealth. But there are avoidable causes of this extreme wealth gap

#### Money in Politics

The ultra wealthy have a huge influence on the next move of governments

- [Billionaires, Not Voters, Are Deciding Elections](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/billionaires-not-voters-are-deciding-elections/) - *TruthDig, Nov 09, 2018*

### Threatening Nuclear War

- [This is exactly how a nuclear war would kill you](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/19/17873822/nuclear-war-weapons-bombs-how-kill) - *Vox.com, Oct 19, 2018*  
Vox lists the 6 easy steps to nuclear war, and how easy it would be for our world to be engulfed in a nuclear winter. They also list the top 3 potential nuclear wars, and demonstrate what happens in a nuclear attack. The threat of nuclear war remains strong even in 2018. In fact, it's one of the most likely disasters that could bring down all of humanity. 
- [Trump insists things are going fine with North Korea. They’re not.](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/11/12/18087516/north-korea-missile-report-trump-csis-base-seoul) - *Vox, Nov 12, 2018*  
Pyongyang is not at all demolishing their nuclear missle program, as Trump insist's that it is

### Individualism

Individualism is the Western created problem of living as and art of emboldening your own self interests. This is dangerous because we share the planet amongst ourselves and need to work together to solve problems that impact all of us.

### Rapidly declining Animal Populations

Declining animal populations are a clear sign that humans are not respecting the planet. 

- [Humanity has wiped out 60% of animal populations since 1970, report finds](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/30/humanity-wiped-out-animals-since-1970-major-report-finds) - *The Guardian, Oct 29 2018*  
- [Protect the last of the wild](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07183-6) - *Nature, Oct 31 2018*  
Global conservation policy must stop the disappearance of Earth’s few intact ecosystems, warn James E. M. Watson, James R. Allan and colleagues.

Biodiversity experts say mass extinction of wildlife is as big a danger as climate change

#### Insects

Insects are at the bottom of the food chain. Without them, we could see a massive ecological extincion event.

#### Microbial mass extinctions

We don't know how bad the pitfalls from this will be. Potentially catastropic.

- [Microbial Mass Extinctions Were Kicked Off By Human Evolution](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2094423-microbial-mass-extinctions-were-kicked-off-by-human-evolution/) - *NewScientist, Jun. 20 2016*  

### Rampant Racism

Racism has not gone away in America. Black people are still unfairly treated, which is dangerous and inhumane.

- [A new study reveals the real reason Obama voters switched to Trump](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/16/17980820/trump-obama-2016-race-racism-class-economy-2018-midterm) - *Vox, Oct 16, 2018*

#### Economic Segregation

Many people are born economically disenfrancised. When you're born into an economically disenfrancised society, you don't have the available tools to repurpose yourself into society.  

### Gender Innequality

When one half of the population is surpressed, then we are imposing serious limitations of what we can do as a collective people. 

#### Perpetuating Patriarchy 

Extreme patriarchies have higher maternal and infant mortality and worse child health.

### Capital Punishment 

Capital punishment leads to culture of cruelty.

- [Trump wants to see the death penalty come “into vogue” again. He’s wanted that for years.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/28/18032438/trump-death-penalty-pittsburgh-shooting) - *Vox, Oct 28, 2018*

### Poor Nutrition

Poor nutrition leads to poor decisions. 

- [Cancer-linked Chemicals Manufactured by 3M Are Turning Up in Drinking Water](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-3M-groundwater-pollution-problem/) - *Bloomberg, Nov. 5 2018*

### Addiction to Meat

With one dietary change, the U.S. could almost meet greenhouse-gas emission goals.

- [Huge reduction in meat-eating ‘essential’ to avoid climate breakdown](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown) - *The Guardian, Oct 10. 2018*  
Huge reductions in meat-eating are essential to avoid dangerous climate change, according to the most comprehensive analysis yet of the food system’s impact on the environment. In western countries, beef consumption needs to fall by 90% and be replaced by five times more beans and pulses. In rich nations, the dietary changes required are ever more stark. UK and US citizens need to cut beef by 90% and milk by 60% while increasing beans and pulses between four and six times. However, the millions of people in poor nations who are undernourished need to eat a little more meat and dairy.
- [If Everyone Ate Beans Instead of Beef](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/535536/?fbclid=IwAR07Dre_We90m8Kv9b4dklY25LIrcpFK6k1hnIiU4UukG34uabkJi_e2bws) - *The Atlantic, Aug. 2, 2017*  
Article points out how if we changed our diets to get rid of beef entirely, that would dramatically reduce the amount of methane and energy and water consumption. With one dietary change, the U.S. could almost meet greenhouse-gas emission goals.
- [We could end factory farming this century](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/15/18088776/end-animal-farming-vegetarian-vegan-meat-alternatives-jacy-reese) - *Vox, Nov 15 2018*

### Fear of Eating Insects

Insects are a healthy and highly available source of protein. 

### Belief that Terraforming Mars should be the Primary Goal for Humanity

We shouldn't believe that Mars is a decent plan B. Living on Mars will be terrible. 

- [The case against Jeff Bezos’s and Elon Musk’s Mars colonies to save humanity](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/22/17991736/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-colonizing-mars-space-blue-origin-spacex) - *Vox.com, Oct 22, 2018*

### Addiction to Convenience

Convenience is what gives us short attention spans. With shrinking attention spans, we grow more and more incapable of drawing out plans to fix 

- [It's  better to be born rich than to be gifted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/09/its-better-be-born-rich-than-talented/?utm_term=.2a256a536916) - *Washington Post, Oct. 9 2018*  

### Religion

Religion takes us away from our abilities to think and reason for ourselves. Climate change can't be solved if you believe that an almighty God is the puppeteer of everything. 

### Massive Over-Population

Over population at a time when humanity isn't equipped to solve a population crisis is a recipe for disaster. 

### Screen Culture and Poisonous Social Media

Screen culture takes us away from our present awareness and distorts our perception of reality. 

### Neoliberalism

Media's influence on politics diverts attention from real issues and hyper-focuses on the unimportant trivialities.

#### Domineering, Unfocused Technocratic Zealots

- [Sundar Pichai of Google: ‘Technology Doesn’t Solve Humanity’s Problems’](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/business/sundar-pichai-google-corner-office.html) - *New York Times, Nov 8 2018*  
"Technology doesn’t solve humanity’s problems. It was always naïve to think so. Technology is an enabler, but humanity has to deal with humanity’s problems. I think we’re both over-reliant on technology as a way to solve things and probably, at this moment, over-indexing on technology as a source of all problems, too."

#### Celebration of Wealth over Virtue

When we celebrate the rich over the virtuous, we forget that money is just a medium of exchange, and not a measure of good will.

#### Sports Culture

Sports culture accentuates tribalism, screen culture, and celebritism. 

### Fear of Death

Socrates beleived that in order to live a good life, you must understand death. Fear of death is the driver of hedonic lifestyles, which are unhelpful.

### A Health Care system that doesn't offer Protection or Care for the Vulnerable

Taking away health care from the vulnerable sends a signal that the society doesn't care about the well being of it's citizens.

- [Health Care, Hatred and Lies](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/opinion/trump-republican-hate.html) - *New York Times, Oct 25 2018*  
Hate is how Republicans change the subject from policy.

#### Physical Ailments

We might be physically unable to think and live at a level that is necessary to tackle problems. All of this could be preventable.

- [THE POLLUTED BRAIN - Evidence builds that dirty air causes Alzheimer’s, dementia](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/brain-pollution-evidence-builds-dirty-air-causes-alzheimer-s-dementia) - *Science Mag, Jan 26, 2017*

How improving air quality could add years to people’s lives around the world.

### A Culture that doesn't Value Knowledge or Education

When education isn't valued, we lose discovering potential solutions to our problems. History repeats itself if we can't learn from it. 

#### Underfunded Childhood Education

Childhood education is critically important for cognitive development. 

- [Early childhood education yields big benefits — just not the ones you think](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/16/17928164/early-childhood-education-doesnt-teach-kids-fund-it) - *Vox, Oct 16, 2018*  

#### A Culture that doesn't Appreciate it's Heritage

When we reject our heritage, then we resort to nativism and believe that what we have was rightfully earned. 

- [As forests are cleared and species vanish, there's one other loss: a world of languages](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/08/why-we-are-losing-a-world-of-languages) - *The Guardian, Jun 7 2014*  
A new report shows a direct link between disappearing habitats and the loss of languages. One in four of the world's 7,000 spoken tongues is now at risk of falling silent for ever as the threat to cultural biodiversity grows

### No ability to think and live and perceive dimensions that are higher than our own

Arguably, if we could understand higher dimensions, then we could have better optics on our existence and be more driven to preserve our future.

### Plastics in Water sources

Impure water is dangerous to ecosystems and human health.

- [Microplastics found in 93% of bottled water tested in global study](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/bottled-water-microplastics-1.4575045) - *CBC, Mar 14, 2018*

### Incapable of Seeing the Current Place of Humanity in the context of All of History

The inability to see how we got here and how quickly we are blowing it, makes it difficult to understand what exactly we should do next.

- [How to help people millions of years from now](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/26/18023366/far-future-effective-altruism-existential-risk-doing-good) - *Vox, Oct 26, 2018*

### The Failiure of the War on Drugs

The war on drugs has incarcerated the mentally ill, instead of educating them back into becoming productive members of our society. 

### Overbearing Corporatism 

When we empower the corporation instead of it's members, we subject the employees to 

## Hope for the Future

There's still hope that we can limit the warming and the damage if we can radically change our behavior and create technologies to help pull carbon out of the atmosphere.

By 2030, global greenhouse gas emissions could be 1.5 to 2.2 GtCO2e/year lower if individual commitments from nearly 6,000 cities, states and regions, and over 2,000 companies are fully implemented, compared to what would be achieved through national policies that are currently underway. This potential reduction amounts to roughly double Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2016.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>You forgot something. Why didn't you list my problem?</summary>
  I am not perfect and I don't have scope into everyone's problems. I am going off of what I perceive to be the most major problems in the world. If you believe that I've missed something, please open up a pull request with a detailed explanation of why a problem you see needs to be added.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How did you order and rank these problems?</summary>
  There is no specific order or ranking. I believe that all of these problems need to be addressed if we are going to make progress. That is why they are all on the same list.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why did you design it like this?</summary>
  I want to have most of the information about human suffering available in 1 document for a reason. I don't want people to say *"well, what about MY problems"* and then immediately bounce off of this page and do something else. We need people to be energized and galvanized. I also wanted to make this as simple as possible to contribute to.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I don't believe in climate change. What is in it for me?</summary>
  You are living in a fictional reality. When you cannot recognize the overwhelming evidence of climate change, you are living in a fictional reality of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. It may not be your fault. Republicans have poisoned the academic sphere for years with anti-climate-change rhetoric. Explore as many of the provided resources as you can. The most enlightened of us are working towards fixing the problem, yet we still need the help of people like you. This problem involves all of us.
