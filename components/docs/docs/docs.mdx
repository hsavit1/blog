# Giant List of Human Created Bullshit that Will Lead to Unprecedented Human and Ecological Genocide Unless Immediately Addressed

## Outline

#### Reason 

I am tired of being blindsided and emotionally paralyzed by countless media stories about how everything is suddenly going to total shit. This is reality of living in America in the year 2018. We are holding onto a figurative wheel of a bus that is driving straight into the Aushwitz of the 21st century if we don't dramatically take control of the wheel. Unfortunately, because everything is seemingly on fire, nobody knows what direction to turn to. Confusion, nihilism, and whataboustism are suffocating and preventing us from solving the problems that we need to solve to ensure the survival of life on Earth.

I am actively putting this list together to categorically outline all of the human created reasons that the world is experiencing so much pain. Ideally this list will be read by the masses and galvanize them with an incredible energy that they will use to tackle these problems before the damage is irreversible.

### Unchecked Capitalism

This is a debatable entry, because the alternatives to capitalism have been historically unsustainable. However, capitalism that is unchecked and unregulated can lead to an economy of masters and slaves that is rigged for those who are born into serious wealth.
