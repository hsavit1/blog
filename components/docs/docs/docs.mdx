# Giant List of Human Created Bullshit that Will Lead to Unprecedented Human and Ecological Genocide Unless Immediately Addressed

## Outline

#### Inspiration 

I am tired of being blindsided and emotionally paralyzed by countless media stories about how everything is suddenly going to total shit. This is reality of living in America in the year 2018. We are holding onto a figurative wheel of a bus that is driving straight into the Aushwitz of the 21st century if we don't dramatically take control of the wheel. Unfortunately, because everything is seemingly on fire, nobody knows what direction to turn to. Confusion, nihilism, and whataboustism are suffocating and preventing us from solving the problems that we need to solve to ensure the survival of life on Earth.

Climate change is the net result of all of our problems. If the Earth becomes uninhabitable except for a select few then we will witness a mass extinction event. This document outlines many of the human faillings that lead to the problem of climate change.

I am actively putting this list together to categorically outline all of the human created reasons that the world is experiencing so much pain. Ideally this list will be read by the masses and galvanize them with an incredible energy that they will use to tackle these problems before the damage is irreversible.

#### The Crisis 

The climate crisis is the ultimate crisis of our lifetime. We have very little time before the crisis spirals out of control. It demands for disparate, marginalized, disadvataged groups to come together and recognize that there is 1 problem that we all need to pitch in and fight against with relentless energy. This shouldn't undermine the importance of fixing their unique individual problems. Rather, the troubles that groups individually face should serve as a perspective for understanding how their unique problems play into the story of how climate change was created in the first place. We cannot solve the climate crisis without being able to look at each other and tell the story of how the climate crisis started in the first place. We are all in this crisis together. It's a metaphorical sinking ship and we all need to recognize each other and work together to try plug the leaking holes.

### Unchecked Capitalism

This is a debatable entry, because the alternatives to capitalism have been historically unsustainable. However, capitalism that is unchecked and unregulated can lead to an economy of masters and slaves that is rigged for those who are born into serious wealth.
